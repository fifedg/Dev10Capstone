Welcome to Group 5's Capstone Project Github!

Most of our deliverables, including the ETL Documentation, Executive Summary, Questions and Napkin Drawing Feedback can be found in the Documents folder. Most are available in PDF form, aside from the Questions, which are attached in both Word document and text file format for ease of viewing.

We have organized the files containing our work on cleaning data, performing Machine Learning and creating visualizations into folders based on the program used. The Excel folder contains spreadsheets used to find correlations and create visualizations, the Power BI folder contains our dashboard, as well as a report used to create visualizations, and the Code folder includes all project code.

The cleaned datasets that we used in this project can be found in the Datasets folder. They have been named according to their contents. A note: There are two documents containing merged data from the states. master_state_data.csv contains all of the columns from each individual file of state data, and state_data_relevant_columns.csv contains only the main columns used in our analysis as well as a couple of computed columns, and was used to create cleaner correlation matrices. 

All of our napkin drawings can be found within the NapkinDrawings folder, and are further categorized into folders by the type of napkin drawing they are.

Our visualizations are available in image form within the Visualizations folder.

Soon, you will be able to find our presentation file, as well as other presentation-related documents in a Presentation folder.

Our Project Managment Plan was created on Trello, and we maintain it there. The link to the Trello board is here: https://trello.com/b/iJybdsKV/project-management-plan
