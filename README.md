Welcome to Group 5's Capstone Project Github!

Here in the base folder, you can find our questions. We've attached them in both Word document and text file format, for ease of viewing. In the future, the ETL documentation, Executive Summary, Presentation slides, Power BI Report, and Napkin Drawing feedback documents will be available here as well, named accordingly.

The cleaned datasets that we used in this project can be found in the Datasets folder. They have been named according to their contents. A note: There are two documents containing merged data from the states. master_state_data.csv contains all of the columns from each individual file of state data, and state_data_relevant_columns.csv contains only the main columns used in our analysis as well as a couple of computed columns, and was used to create cleaner correlation matrices. 

All of our napkin drawings can be found within the NapkinDrawings folder, and are further categorized into folders by the type of napkin drawing they are.

Once our visualizations will be complete, they will be added to a folder titled Visualizations.

Our Project Managment Plan was created on Trello, and we maintain it there. The link to the Trello board is here: https://trello.com/b/iJybdsKV/project-management-plan
